(display "Problem 1: Writing a Fahrenheit to Celsius converter:\n\n")

;;    Define a Racket function called fahr->cels that consumes a single
;;    input (representing the temperature in Fahrenheit) and returns   
;;    as output the corresponding temperature in Celsius.
;;    
;;    The appropriate conversion formula is:  c = 5.0(f-32)/9.0.
;;    (You'll have to change this expression a little to get it
;;    into the form of a Racket expression.)
;;    
;;    Make sure that you test your fahr->cels function on the
;;    following examples:
;;    
;;           f = 32.0, f = 212.0, and f = -40.0.
    
;;
;;    After writing the check-within statements, include them in a
;;    display statement so the actual test can be seen in the output
;;    that is written to the interactions window.

(display "Problem 2: Writing an area-of-circle function:\n\n")

;;  Define a Racket function area-of-circle that consumes a single
;;  input argument called radius (a number representing the radius of a circle) and 
;;  returns as output the area of the circle.  
    
;;  Mathematics books tell us that the area of a circle is calculated
;;  as PI * (radius * radius).

;;    Make sure that you test your area-of-circle function on the
;;    following examples:
;;    
;;           radius = 5 should be approximately 78.5
;;           radius = 6 should be approximately 113.09
;;           radius = 2 should be approximately 12.56
;;           radius = 3 should be approximately 28.26

(display "
Contract: (area-of-circle radius) --> number
Input:    radius, a number representing the radius of a circle
Output:   a number, the area of the circle.\n")

(printf "\nPROBLEM 3:  Writing an area-of-hexagon function\n")

;;    Make sure that you test your area-of-hexagon function on the
;;    following examples:
;;    
;;           side = 5  should be approximately 64.95
;;           side = 6  should be approximately 93.53
;;           side = 12 should be approximately 374.12

(display "
Contract: (area-of-hexagon side) --> number
Input:    side, a number representing side-length of hexagon
Output:   a number, the area of the hexagon.\n")

(display "\nPROBLEM 4:  Writing an area-of-nut function\n")

;;    Combine calls to the functions you wrote in problems 2 and 3 to 
;;    produce a function called area-of-nut. According to Wikipedia, 
;;    a nut is a type of fastener with a threaded hole, usually made
;;    of metal.

;;    The area-of-nut function consumes two numeric inputs called 
;;    side and radius, representing the side length of the outer hexagon
;;    and the radius of the circle in the center of the hexagon. Calculate
;;    the area of the nut by calling the functions you wrote for Problems
;;    2 and 3 in the area-of-nut function.

;;    Make sure that you test your area-of-nut function on the following
;;    examples:

;;    (area-of-nut 5 2) -->  should be approximately 52.39
;;    (area-of-nut 6 1) -->  should be approximately 90.39
;;    (area-of-nut 12 5) --> should be approximately 295.58
 
;;    
;; DISPLAY THE CONTRACT, INPUT, AND OUTPUT AND EXAMPLES FOR THE 
;; area-of-nut FUNCTION BELOW THIS LINE:

(display "
Contract: (area-of-nut side radius)
Input:    side is a number, the side length of the
          hexagon and radius is a number, the radius
          of the inner circle
Output:   a number, the area of the nut.\n")
