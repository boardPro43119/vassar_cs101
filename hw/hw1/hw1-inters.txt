Homework 2

===================================================

Problem 1:
Contract: (maxx x y) --> number
Input:    x and y are numbers.
Output:   A number, the maximum of x and y

Function Tests:
(check-expect (maxx 2 3) 3)
(check-expect (maxx 5 1) 5)
(check-expect (maxx 4 4) 4)

Function definition:
(define maxx
  (lambda (x y)
    (if (> x y) x y)))


Problem 2:
Contract:     (cake-msg p) --> number
Input:        p is an integer.
Output:       A number, p multiplied by the number of calories
              per piece of cake
Side-effect:  Prints a message that depends on p:
              when p = 0, prints: I didn't get any cake!
              when p = 1, prints: I ate 1 piece of cake.
              when p = 2, prints: I ate 2 pieces of cake.
              when p = 3, prints: I ate 3 pieces of cake.
              ...and so on

Constant Definition:
(define calories-per-piece 300)

Function Tests:
(check-expect (cake-msg 0) 0)
(check-expect (cake-msg 1) 300)
(check-expect (cake-msg 4) 1200)

Function Definition:
(define cake-msg
  (lambda (p)
    (cond
      [(= p 0) "I didn't get any cake!\n" 0]
      [(= p 1) "I ate 1 piece of cake.\n" calories-per-piece]
      [else ("I ate ~a pieces of cake.\n" n) (* calories-per-piece n)])))


Problem 3:
Contract:  (quadrant x y) -> number
Input:     x and y are two numbers
Output:    A number specifying the quadrant in which the point lies:
           when x and y are positive, return 1
           when x is negative and y is positive, return 2
           when x is negative and y is negative, return 3
           when x is positive and y is negative, return 4
           when either or both x and y are 0, return 0

Constant Definition:
(define axis 0)
(define quadrant-i 1)
(define quadrant-ii 2)
(define quadrant-iii 3)
(define quadrant-iv 4)

Function Tests:
(check-expect (quadrant 0 0) 0)
(check-expect (quadrant 0 5) 0)
(check-expect (quadrant -2 0) 0)
(check-expect (quadrant 1 4) 1)
(check-expect (quadrant 5 -6) 2)
(check-expect (quadrant -12 -7) 3)
(check-expect (quadrant -9 3) 4)

Function Definition:
(define quadrant
  (lambda (x y)
    (cond
      [(or (= x 0) (= y 0)) axis]
      [(and (> x 0) (> y 0)) quadrant-i]
      [(and (< x 0) (> y 0)) quadrant-ii]
      [(and (< x 0) (< y 0)) quadrant-iii]
      [else quadrant-iv])))
Problem 4:
Contract:  (data-type-of d) -> quoted symbol
Input:     d is any valid scheme type
Output:    A quoted symbol (not a string) representing the data type
           of d, one of:  number, boolean, list, symbol, string, character,
           or unknown.

Function Tests:
(check-expect (data-type-of 30) 'number)
(check-expect (data-type-of #f) 'boolean)
(check-expect (data-type-of ()) 'list)
(check-expect (data-type-of 'bp) 'symbol)
(check-expect (data-type-of "Hello") 'string)
(check-expect (data-type-of #\A) 'character)
(check-expect (data-type-of +) 'unknown)

Function Definition:
(define data-type-of
  (lambda (input)
    (cond
      [(number? input) 'number]
      [(boolean? input) 'boolean]
      [(list? input) 'list]
      [(symbol? input) 'symbol]
      [(string? input) 'string]
      [(char? input) 'character]
      [else 'unknown])))


I didn't get any cake!
I ate 1 piece of cake.
I ate 4 pieces of cake.
All 20 tests passed!
